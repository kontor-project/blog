## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to establish an intended roadmap for the entire project. Each milestone is assigned to a date, on which a major part of the project will be complete. There are 3 major phases in the project. Note that a phase is dependent on it's predecessor. In other words, upon failure of completion of one of the phase, the next will not take place. It therefore makes sense to plan the details of a phase, upon the completion of the preceding phase.

## Phase One

### Description

This phase focuses on the conception of the aircraft alone. The main subject of work will be designing and experimenting with variations in the design, using 3D modeling tools and aerodynamic simulations. During this phase, a minimum of 2 models of the aircraft shall be built, to cement the design.

### Timeline

Below we have a table of milestones associated with dates and a definition of done

| Start Date & End Date | Objective | Definition of Done |
| --  | -- | -- |
| 01.01.2020  **15.01.2020** | Create project organization and repositories | A public organization in github, with at least 1 repository (for the aircraft design)|
| 15.01.2020  **01.02.2020** | Create the first 3D model of the aircraft | A rudimentary 3D model|
| 01.02.2020  **undefined** | Spread the word! Share the project with different communities | Public knowledge of the project, at least 3 other contributors |
| 01.04.2020  **15.03.2020** | Review powerplant layouts and battery options | A list of motor and battery options for the aircraft |
| 01.02.2020  **01.06.2020** | Optimize model using aerodynamic simulation tools | A software optimized aircraft model |
| 15.03.2020  **10.05.2020** | Aircraft building materials study | A set of materials used for the aircraft construction |
| 01.05.2020  **01.07.2020** | Construction of the first model aircraft using materials chosen | A scale model of the aircraft design, fully functional |
| 01.07.2020  **01.08.2020** | Construction of a second model aircraft based on any feedback from the first | A scale model with improvements made over the first model |
| 10.06.2020  **15.08.2020** | Compute the total cost of the aircraft | A spreadsheet or report containing the total cost of the aircraft

## Phase Two

This phase focuses on the construction of the first aircraft. A minimum of 2 airframes must be completed. The purpose of the first airframe is to stress it till breaking point, in order to officially state the limitations of the aircraft. The second airframe will get a powerplant fitted, and will be used to conduct a maiden flight. The construction of the first two prototypes will be much more financially demanding than the Phase One, so this is where funding becomes a requirement. The details are uncertain, but a "go fund me" campaign and/or a third party investment would be the most probable solutions.

## Phase Three

The third phase consist of building a monetizing the Kontor project. This can ocour in a variety of ways. The two most logical are to sell partly built aircraft (as kits) and/or complete ready to fly aircraft.
